<h2>Street Fighter</h2>
<p>"The series that brought fighting games into the mainstream. This game focuses heavily on grounded and medium pace play. This series has very basic inputs so while it can be hard for players to execute moves when they first start this series. It is a good way to learn basic inputs for new players."</p>
<h2>Sammurai Shodown</h2>
<p>"Similar to street fighter in having very basic inputs and grounded play. However this game is played at a very slow pace. This is a good series to get into if you are not interested in very long combos as in this game you mainly look to get stray hits instead of long combos."</p>
<h2>Tekken</h2>
<p>"While other games on this list are played on a 2d plane Tekken is played on a 3d plane. This means not only is there movement forward and backwards but up and down. Tekken is a game played at a very fast pace and has some execution that is considered hard for even pro players. So this game is not recommended all that often for new fighting game players."</p>
<h2>Guilty Gear</h2>
<p>Guilty Gear is what is know among the community as an "anime fighter". This generally means that the game is played at a very fast pace and a lot of interactions take place in the air as well as on the ground. This game is another example of games that should probably not be the starting point for beginners as it is executionaly very hard and it is hard to follow since matches tend to go very fast.</p>
<h2>Smash Bros</h2>
<p>Smash is very different from every other game on this list as the goal of every other game on this list is to get your opponents health to 0. In Smash your goal is to knock the openent of the stage. Smash is a very good place for beginners to start as it is executionally very easy as there are no special inputs for special moves so anyone can do them. It is another game that is played in the air a lot although grounded play is also necesarry for success.  </p>
