<h2>Advantage/Disadvantage</h2>
<p>"A player who is at advantage is in charge of the game and is free to go on the offensive while players at disadvantage must be defensive. A basic example of this is when one player knocksdown another player. The player standing is at advantage while the one on the ground is at disadvantage."</p>
<h2>Nuetral</h2>
<p>"Neutral is when neither player is at Advantage or Disadvantage. Every round starts the players at nuetral"</p>
<h2>Oki</h2>
<p>"Oki is timing an attack to hit someone as soon as they stand up from being knocked down. You should go for Oki most of the time after a knockdown to push your advantage."</p>
<h2>Read</h2>
<p>A read is when a play guesses what their openent is going to do.</p>
